The GUI allows for acquiring full field optical coherent tomography images and fluorescent images on a second camera (optionnal).

In order to be able to run the program, you will need to install the following:
- Zaber toolbox to control the motors.
- Image acquistion toolbox with Bitflow (or you own framegrabber) depedencies.

Then you will probably need to change:
- Serial ports for your own motors.
- Initialisation files for your own cameras.
