The GUI allows for acquiring full field optical coherent tomography images and fluorescent images on a second camera (optionnal).

In order to be able to run the program, you will need to install the following:
- Zaber toolbox to control the motors.
- Image acquistion toolbox with Bitflow (or you own framegrabber) depedencies.

Then you will probably need to change:
- Serial ports for your own motors.
- Initialisation files for your own cameras.

Features:
- Real time parallel OCT and fluorescence imaging.
- Real time dynamic OCT imaging.

Remarks:
- ROI for OCT (Adimec) camera is working weirdly. To be corrected in a futur release.
- Linear 5 phases modulation is not implemented yet.
